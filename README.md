# SavageWorldsCreatureHelperUI
This UI will eventually integrate the functionality of the backend present in the repository SavageWorldsCreatureHelper.
Currently, two solutions are being pursued. One will utilize a SQL server like the alpha of the Creature Helper alpha, and the other will utilize CSVs
in order to function, independent of any connections.
